        <h1>The Paint</h1>
        <p>
          Paintballs, also simply called "paint", are spherical gelatin capsules
          containing primarily polyethylene glycol, other non-toxic and
          water-soluble substances, and dye. Paintballs are made of materials
          found in food items, and are edible but taste disagreeable as they
          tend to dry up the mouth. The use of polyethylene glycol (a laxative)
          in the fill can also cause gastrointestinal distress in individuals
          who eat a number of paintballs; therefore, they should be kept out of
          reach of young children. Early paintballs were made of glass and
          filled with inedible oil-based paint, since they were made for marking
          trees and cattle, but modern paintballs should easily wash out of most
          clothing. The color of the shell does not necessarily indicate the
          color of the fill. Most common paintballs and paintball markers are
          described as .68 caliber (17.3 mm), but many factors affect the exact
          dimensions. Paintballs and barrels vary in size from .43 caliber to
          .71 caliber (17 mm to 18 mm). In addition, paintballs are seldom
          perfectly round and are very sensitive to heat and moisture. A hot or
          humid day may result in paint swelling or becoming misshapen. Care
          should be taken to keep paintballs out of the sun and away from
          moisture. An insulated cooler works well for this on the field. The
          gelatin shell of a paintball is designed to break upon impact,
          although ricochets or "bounces" may occur. There are many types of
          paintballs, including glow in the dark paintballs for use at night,
          scented paintballs, and formulations for winter play. When dropped on
          the ground, groundwater or condensation may swell the paintball, which
          could cause a jam in the barrel or rupture and foul the internal
          workings of the marker. Dropped ammunition is known as 'loose paint',
          and should not be used in paintball markers. Generally speaking,
          paintballs of greater price are subjected to more stringent
          manufacturing processes, quality checks, and standards, making their
          size and shape more consistent. This is very important for accuracy.
          Better paintballs also tend to have thinner shells to improve the
          frequency of breaking on impact rather than bouncing, and thicker,
          more opaque fills that are more visible and harder to wipe off. While
          it is theoretically possible to freeze a water-based paintball, the
          polyethylene glycol additive drastically lowers the freezing point of
          the mixture, making it highly unlikely to actually freeze it into
          something harder than a regular paintball. When introduced to a very
          cold environment, the paintball's shell will most likely dimple
          (making it less accurate) and the shell will become brittle.
